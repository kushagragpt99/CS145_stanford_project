# CS145_stanford_project

A primary objective for every country is to maintain the health and ensure the well being of its citizens. Towards this goal, countries work towards providing the best infrastructure and making the best policies. Despite the best efforts by the nations, some external agents like the actions of other countries, natural factors like population, landmass also influence the health of the citizens. These factors can be quantified at a country level and leveraged to predict the life expectancy of the citizens. 

This project uses data on countries provided by the World Bank as part of BigQuery's publicly available datasets. The central problem we want to explore is identifying the key factors contributing to above-average life expectancy at birth. We have divided the life-expectancy into three classes, namely â€”
1. Early age (less than 68)
2. Middle age (68 to 75)
3. Old age (over 75)


We want to identify the class a country belongs to in a year given information about the country.

To better understand the central problem, we first answer some supplementary questions to guide our solution and break down the problem into solvable chunks. These questions help us identify features that will be useful in predicting the life-expectancy



* How are health parameters like undernourishment, presence of anaemia, the prevalence of breastfeeding, etc., correlated with the average life expectancy?
* How do standards of education like enrollment in primary or secondary education, internet users, female enrollment ratio, etc., affect the average life expectancy?
* How do financial factors like the GDP per capita, government expenditure on education and healthcare, import-export levels, etc., correlate to the average life expectancy?
* How do world development indicators like hospital beds, access to electricity, no of physicians, etc., influence the average life expectancy?
* Does the population of a country affect the average life expectancy?
